# Butterfly-Classification

This is a competition to learn about CNN network architectures of class AI1801.

In this contest, we will use any network architectures we have know (Alex Net, ResNet, Inception Net, Mobile Netâ€¦) to solve the problem of species identification of a butterfly photo.

The training data is 5000 labeled images of 75 butterfly species. Let's build a CNN network to classify butterfly imageas in the test folder (1499 pictures).
